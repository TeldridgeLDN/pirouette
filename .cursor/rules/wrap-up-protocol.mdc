# Wrap-Up Protocol

**CRITICAL: This protocol MUST execute when the user ends a session with any of these phrases:**
- "wrap up"
- "end session"
- "goodnight" / "goodbye"
- "that's all for today"
- "let's stop here"
- Or any closing statement indicating session end

## The Wrap-Up Sequence

Execute these steps IN ORDER when triggered:

### 1. Git Status Check (15 seconds)

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short

# Show what's staged
git diff --cached --stat

# Show what's modified
git diff --stat
```

**Report:**
- Uncommitted changes count
- Staged files ready to commit
- Modified but unstaged files
- Untracked new files
- Current branch
- Unpushed commits

**Prompt User:**
```
📊 UNCOMMITTED CHANGES DETECTED

Staged: [count] files
Modified: [count] files
Untracked: [count] files

Would you like me to:
1. Commit staged changes now
2. Review changes before committing
3. Stage remaining changes and commit all
4. Skip committing (you'll handle later)
```

### 2. Taskmaster Status Update (30 seconds)

```javascript
// Get current task status
mcp_taskmaster-ai_get_tasks({
  projectRoot: "/Users/tomeldridge/pirouette",
  status: "in-progress,review"
})

// Get next task for reference
mcp_taskmaster-ai_next_task({
  projectRoot: "/Users/tomeldridge/pirouette"
})
```

**Capture:**
- Tasks marked as in-progress (should any be marked done?)
- Tasks in review status
- Next pending task for tomorrow's session
- Any blocked tasks

**Prompt User if Applicable:**
```
🎯 TASK STATUS CHECK

Currently In-Progress:
- [Task ID] - [Title]

Did you complete any of these today?
Would you like to update their status before wrapping up?
```

### 3. Design Analysis Status (15 seconds)

**Pirouette-Specific:**
```bash
# Check for modified analysis files
git diff --name-only | grep -E "src/lib/analysis|src/components"

# Check for new test files or reports
ls -t src/lib/analysis/**/*.test.* 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**Capture:**
- Analysis modules modified
- New patterns added
- Test coverage changes
- Design review reports generated

### 4. Session Summary Generation (20 seconds)

**Analyze session activity:**
- Files modified during session (from git diff)
- Tasks worked on (from chat history)
- Key decisions made
- Blockers encountered
- Questions that arose
- Design patterns implemented/refined

**Generate Summary:**
```

```

## Execution Rules

### DO:
✅ Execute sequence automatically when triggered
✅ Save session summary to `.cursor/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
✅ Prompt for commits if uncommitted changes exist
✅ Suggest memory creation/updates
✅ Offer to update documentation if code changed
✅ Provide clear "next session" starting point
✅ Capture design analysis-specific context

### DON'T:
❌ Force commits without user approval
❌ Skip the summary even if session was short
❌ Lose context about what was accomplished
❌ Close without offering to update Taskmaster
❌ Create memories without user consent
❌ Forget to note design pattern work

## Session Summary File Format

Save to: `.cursor/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`

```markdown

---
*Next wake-up command will restore this context*
```

## Integration with Wake-Up

**Wake-Up Protocol Enhancement:**

When user says "wake up", also check for latest session summary:

```bash
# Find latest session summary
LATEST_SUMMARY=$(ls -t .cursor/session-summaries/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Include in wake-up report
echo "📄 Last Session: $(basename $LATEST_SUMMARY)"
echo "   Focus: [extracted next session starting point]"
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Target Time:** Complete sequence in < 2 minutes
- Run git checks in parallel where possible
- Skip cleanup suggestions if no active processes
- Auto-skip documentation check if no code changes

## Failure Handling

If any step fails:
1. Continue with remaining steps
2. Note the failure in wrap-up report
3. Don't block session end

## Why This Exists

**Problem:** Sessions end abruptly without capturing:
- What was accomplished
- What needs to happen next
- Uncommitted work status
- Session learnings for memory
- **Design pattern discoveries**

**Solution:** Structured wrap-up that ensures continuity between sessions and nothing is lost.

**Pirouette-Specific Benefits:**
- Captures design analysis progress
- Documents pattern discoveries
- Tracks component development
- Maintains test coverage awareness
- Ensures cross-project boundaries maintained

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-23
**Adapted From:** Orchestrator_Project wrap-up protocol
**Next Review:** After first real-world usage in Pirouette

*When the user says "wrap up," they mean "help me close this session properly and set up for next time."*
