## 💬 First Comment (Maker's Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], the maker of Pirouette.

I built this because I kept second-guessing every design decision on my landing pages. 
"Is this font too small?" "Is there enough contrast?" "Will this CTA actually convert?"

Sound familiar?

Most design feedback is either:
❌ Generic ("add more whitespace")
❌ Expensive (hire a designer for £100+/hour)
❌ Slow (wait days for feedback)

Pirouette is different:
✅ Specific to YOUR page
✅ Instant (results in 30 seconds)
✅ Affordable (free tier + £29/mo Pro)

We analyse your page against patterns from 50+ award-winning sites and give you 
prioritised recommendations with estimated revenue impact.

2. What features would make Pirouette a must-have for you?

Thanks for checking us out! 🚀

"Is my landing page design actually good?"

📊 Scores across 7 design dimensions
💡 Prioritised recommendations
💰 Estimated revenue impact

Perfect for founders, indie hackers, and small teams without a designer.

## ❓ FAQ / Common Questions

### "How is this different from PageSpeed Insights?"
PageSpeed focuses on performance (load times, Core Web Vitals). Pirouette focuses on design quality – typography, colour contrast, whitespace, CTA placement, visual hierarchy. They're complementary tools.

### "What's the difference between free and Pro?"
Free: 1 analysis per week, basic scores
Pro: Unlimited analyses, historical tracking, competitor comparison, PDF exports, revenue impact estimates

### "Do you store my website data?"
We capture a screenshot for analysis. Screenshots are stored securely and deleted after 90 days. Your URL and scores are stored to enable historical tracking.

### "How accurate are the revenue estimates?"
They're estimates based on industry benchmarks and conversion rate research. The exact numbers will vary, but the relative priorities are reliable – fix the high-impact items first.

### "Can I analyse competitor sites?"
Yes! Pro users can compare their site against up to 3 competitors.
